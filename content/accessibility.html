            <p>We have created our website to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA standards.&nbsp; We are currently researching and working to improve our website to be even sharper, clearer, and incorporate all of the best practices from HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.&nbsp; We will never stop trying to improve access to our digital offerings.</p>

            <p class="pt-3"><span class="h4-heading"><strong>Actions Taken</strong></span></p>

            <p>Some of the measures taken to make the Mandated Reporter&nbsp;website accessible&ZeroWidthSpace; include:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>adding alt text to all images</li>
             <li>ensuring a minimum 4.5:1 color ratio for all text</li>

             <li>maintaining a consistent and predictable &ZeroWidthSpace;layout and organization</li>
